# Custom Watch face for Android Wear

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/9elements/9elements-One-for-Android-Wear/master/9elements-one-blog.jpg "Custom Watch Face - 9elements One")

This is an example project that shows you how to implement a custom watch face.
The main project codes lies in the `wear` module. You can install it directly to the wearable device via USB.
The big secret how to create a custom watch face lies in a special intent filter described by the next section:

## Modifying the AndroidManifest.xml

```xml
<activity
    android:theme="@android:style/Theme.DeviceDefault.NoActionBar"
    android:name=".NineWatchWearActivity"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:allowEmbedded="true"
    >
    <!-- Preview for when the user goes to change watchfaces -->
    <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.clockwork.home.preview" android:resource="@drawable/preview" />
    <!-- Intent filter to make the activity show up in the watchface choices -->
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="com.google.android.clockwork.home.category.HOME_BACKGROUND" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.version" android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version" />
```

# TODO

* Using `WatchViewStub` to differentiate between a square or round wearable.
* Finding out why the dim removes the views when the debug cable is connected.
* Checking why the battery is drained so fast.

# ENVIRONMENT

This example has been created with AndroidStudio 0.8.1 - it has also been tested on the Samsung Gear Live.
